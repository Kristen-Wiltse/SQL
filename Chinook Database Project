This project is designed to showcase my SQL skills. I have given a one answer example beneath each question, since including the whole table could get a bit lengthy! 
This database called Chinook had several different tables included and needed joining to gain different information from each table. I thoroughly enjoyed this project and can't wait to use my skills in my next project!
As always, if you have any questions about my work, feel free to reach out to me. 
This was fun to play around with!
